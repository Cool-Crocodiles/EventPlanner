## Usage

> Some usage instructions

This app is aimed to facilitate easy planning of upcoming events that you want to attend.
It is a simple-to-use app that allows the user to simply input the date, city and category of interest. This information is fed
into the Eventful API and all the relevant events are retrieved. The user then has the possibility to add events to an events list,
which is sorted by date. The list is stored persistently in a database that is unique to each user. Further revisions to the list
are possible by adding more events and deleting unwanted events.

## Requirements

- Mongoose 4.8.x
